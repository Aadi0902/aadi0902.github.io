As part of the MATE underwater ROV competition, our team built an underwater submarine to perform various tasks as defined in the competition problem statement.
Robosub features:
- 3 DOF gripper for object relocation
- 4 horizontal thrusters for maneuvering in the horizontal plane and motion in the pitch direction
- 2 vertical thrusters for vertical motion as well as roll
- Stereo camera for object recognition and determining depth as well as underwater line following
