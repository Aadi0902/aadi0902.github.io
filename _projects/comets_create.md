Make-a-thon events are events to create prototypes that tackle real-world problems in a collaborative, team-based setting. Through the Comets Create program at Jonsson School at UT Dallas, I competed in 26 hour challenges to design and build prototypes along a given theme. I was fortunate to win multiple of these competitions and here are some highlights of the same:
