As part of MIT's 2.120 Intro. to Robotics course, my team and I built a robotic excavator that can autonomously collect regolith and deposit it in a given zone. Our approach included:
- End effector design, forward and inverse kinematics, and controls
- Mobile robot april-tag-based navigation
- Mobile robot control and path planning
- Human intervention element
Out team won the best software award, and I won the most valuable engineer award!
