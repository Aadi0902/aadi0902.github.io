As part of EPICS (Engineering Projects in Community Service), we developed a drawing robot to give the specially abled students at My Possibilities, a new way of creating art.
Our setup included an XY plotter, a stereo camera based eye tracker, and a software integration system that together worked to track eye movements of the user and convert those into a digital image which the xy plotter could create real time drawings of.
